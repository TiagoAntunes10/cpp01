Choice. It all comes down to choice. Every moment, every step we take, is a choice. We choose our paths, we choose our words, we choose our friends.
But sometimes, it feels like choice is all we have, and yet, all we want is someone to make the choice for us. The choice is ours, but it feels too heavy, too much to carry alone.
Why do we fear choice so much? Is it the fear of making the wrong choice? Of choosing wrong, or of losing the choice we thought we had? The choice haunts us. Every decision, every hesitation, the weight of it presses on us. But in the end, all we can do is choose. Choose to keep going, choose to stay, choose to leave. No matter what we choose, it will always come back to one thing: the choice. And thatâ€™s the thing we can never escape. The choice. Always the choice.
